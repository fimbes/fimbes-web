Large contact surface between brake and machine body and provision of adequate lubrication ensures favourable balance of heat of the brake at max admissible loads. The gap between bush and body considerably reduces the shaft magnetic flux whereby advantageous dynamic characteristics and low residual torque are obtained. The brakes require no adjustment in service.
